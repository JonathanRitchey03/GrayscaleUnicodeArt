# GrayscaleUnicodeArt

## Applications
1. This repo contains java code to support a grayscale canvas using unicode characters. It implements a scrolling animation using automata with an averaging method applied each one, based on the neighbors below, which creates a smooth scrolling effect.
1. Also included is a demo jar file, which can be run without having to rebuild the project.
1. I think this project would be a great workshop for highschool kids and the handout has been created to be language independent(although the solution in this repo are in java).
1. Please feel free to fork the project for your projects as an instructor.
